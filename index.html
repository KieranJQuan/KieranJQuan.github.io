<p>Hold on, I'm trying to learn more HTMl and CSS so this page doesn't fulfill any purpose other than that for now.</p>
<p>That's why the default image is still down here.</p>
<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/daftpunktocat-thomas.gif" id="octocat" alt="octocat-gif" />
<p>Somehow last time there was an end <em>emphasis</em> tag here before.</p>
<p>I feel like <strong>bold</strong> text is more emphatic though.</p>
<p>Do the default headings still look weird?</p>
<h1>probably.</h1>
